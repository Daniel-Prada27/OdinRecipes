        <h2>Delicious and simple to make eggs</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, 
            set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached 
            egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-items">
            <li>1½ tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs/li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>

            <li>
                Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully crack the eggs into the skillet and let cook until 
                the whites have almost set, this takes about 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat 
                to medium-low, and let cook until whites have set, yolks are still 
                runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper 
                and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.
            </li>
